> _"Consistency beats intensity — one problem at a time."_  

Welcome to my **100 Days of DSA Challenge!**  
Over the next 100 days, I’ll be solving **mid to hard-level DSA problems** in **C++** to strengthen my fundamentals, improve my logic-building, and become a better problem solver overall.  

---

## 🧠 About the Challenge

- **Language:** C++  
- **Duration:** 100 Days  
- **Daily Target:** Solve at least **2–3 DSA problems** each day  
- **Objective:** Build consistency, improve problem-solving, and prepare for coding interviews & contests  
- **Platforms Used:** LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and others

## 📊 My Progress Tracker

All of my daily progress, including topics, problem names, and insights, will be maintained in a **Google Sheets Tracker**.  
This will be made public once I complete the challenge 👇

## ⚔️ Challenge Rules

1. Solve **2–3 problems daily** — consistency > intensity  
2. Focus on **conceptual clarity** rather than just solutions  
3. Document learnings and approaches for future revision  
4. Push commits regularly to maintain accountability  
5. No skipping days — make each day count 💪
